## 1. Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- **var** → Old way, works inside functions, can be redeclared and changed.
- **let** → works inside blocks (`{}`), can be changed but not redeclared.
- **const** → once set, it can’t be changed.

## 2. Difference between `map()`, `forEach()`, and `filter()`
- **map()** → Loops through items and returns a *new array* with changes.
- **forEach()** → Loops through items, but doesn’t return anything.
- **filter()** → Returns a *new array* with items that match a condition.

## 3. Arrow Functions in ES6
- A shorter way to write functions.

## 4. Destructuring Assignment in ES6
- A simple way to pull values out of arrays or objects.


## 5. Template Literals in ES6
- Template literals use backticks (`) and let you put variables inside ${ }.
- They are simpler than using + to join strings.
